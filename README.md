# Sitting-Posture-Correction Alert System Using MediaPipe

## Overview

This project aims to build a sitting posture detection and alert system using MediaPipe Pose. The system detects body posture from a side view, analyzes the inclination of the neck and torso, and sends alerts if poor posture is detected for an extended period.

## Features

- **Posture Detection**: Detects body posture using MediaPipe Pose.
- **Inclination Measurement**: Measures neck and torso inclination angles.
- **Camera Alignment**: Ensures the camera is properly aligned to capture the side view.
- **Alert System**: Sends alerts if poor posture is detected for more than 30 seconds.
